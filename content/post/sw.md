* Rasmus lerdorf quote frm the ennd of "25 years of php"



<blockquote>

people's lives it was a very nice quote from the secretary national defense of the Philippines and this is why I do this stuff this is why I can stand here and say I really don't like programming at the programming conference because programming is not about the bits and bytes it's not about the programming it's not about the color of the hammer it's about this it's about the things that we do with the programming that we do we don't program because we program, we program because we solve problems with this programming, the goal here it's the solutions you're building and that's what keeps me going and that's why when people rant about how terrible PHP is and how stupid I am on their WordPress blogs, it really doesn't matter it doesn't bother me so work on things that matter to you

it's very very important, and I can tell you as someone over 50 who is still doing this stuff if you don't do this you're going to become a mediocre middle manager in an insurance company and things are gonna suck if you find things if you find solutions problems to solve that you're passionate about that matter to you you can do this stuff forever. 

to me this is the picture of the world there are dreamers there are coders and then there are the folks in the middle who are a bit of both I am sort of right on the left edge of the hacker here I can code just enough to get things started to get sort of the solution on the way and then I need lots of help but I'm a huge dreamer and it takes both to do anything interesting I think.

thank you very much

<br/>-- Lerdorf, Rasmus, [25 years of PHP, php.barcelona]( https://youtu.be/Qa_xVjTiOUw), 2019
